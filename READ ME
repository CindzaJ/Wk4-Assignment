This week's assignment is a bit more interesting where we are allocated to create a series of selective multiple choice questions with set time + retaining information of guest name initials. 
I will begin with working out with the layout of the HTML and Javascript first, followed by using CSS format as the final part of the initialization. 
However, upon researching and writing this particular code, I have noticed the issues on the context of Choice which was interpreted as 'Null'.
